Once upon a time in two houses which were right next to each other there lived James and Bob. James and Bob were friends 
since kindergarden. They were best friends. They would go to the park nearby everday, but it was now winter and it was snowing
really hard. They lived sadly ever after. Although it was not the end. They forgot about Joseph. Joseph lived on the other 
side of the road to Bob and James. Bob and James hated Joseph because he was very annoying. Bob and James hated Joseph since
kindergarden. Joseph always broke the big statues Bob and James made using blocks.
